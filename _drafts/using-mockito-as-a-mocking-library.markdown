Few past days, I am struggling with Unit Test. Yes, I have never writing unit test for my codes before, and this is something
new to me. Yes, you did not read it wrong, it is a new stuff for me. Okay, I know what is a unit test since long time ago. But
I never implemented it before, and yah it was a bad coding behaviour.

Since I work in my current company, I learn a lot of things including writing test. So, here is a note about my learning experience
creating unit test.

I use jUnit for testing and Mockito as a mock library.

What is `mock library` actually?
