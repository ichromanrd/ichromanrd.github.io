Relationship in Spring JPA is a thing that commonly used in Spring Boot application, but I often forgot how to implement it, LOL. So everytime I do it I must google again an again. Then I decide to make a dedicated post for it, so it will be easier to look up later.

In this post I will write down needed items and terms in Spring JPA relationship. Mainly there are: 

- One to One
- One to Many
- Many to One
- Many to Many
- FetchType
- Composite Keys
